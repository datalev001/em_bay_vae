# Decoding Latent Variables: Comparing Bayesian, EM, and VAE Approaches
A Deep Dive into Mathematical Foundations, A/B Testing Applications, and Choosing the Right Method for Your Data Challenges
Ever wondered how to uncover hidden details in your data when things aren't fully clear? Think about running an A/B test for a marketing campaign - sales numbers are there, but the true impact might be buried. This paper explores three methods to tackle such challenges: Expectation-Maximization (EM), Bayesian estimation, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), each offering unique insights into latent variable analysis.
The EM algorithm handles missing pieces by iteratively guessing and refining hidden details. In A/B testing, it works for both masked and fully observed treatments, bridging gaps in incomplete data. Bayesian estimation adds a probabilistic layer, combining prior knowledge with observed data to reveal not only results but also confidence levels, making it ideal for comparing group performance and likelihoods.
VAEs, a rising star in AI, are widely known for recreating images and generating data. But they go further, uncovering hidden patterns by building a "latent space" and simulating "what-if" scenarios. Unlike EM or Bayesian methods, VAEs generate new possibilities, making them perfect for exploratory analysis.
This paper examines how VAEs connect to traditional methods like EM and Bayesian estimation. Through experiments, I compare their strengths and demonstrate how they connect. By the end, you'll know when to use each method. Let's dive in!
